🚀 CITSA Alumni Connect

**A modern alumni–student networking platform built for real communities**

CITSA Alumni Connect is a **full-stack web application** designed to keep **students and alumni connected long after graduation**.
It replaces scattered WhatsApp groups and forgotten Facebook pages with a **secure, structured, and scalable platform** for mentorship, events, and professional networking.

Built with **PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, and OTP-based authentication**, this project demonstrates real-world system design, role-based access control, and community-focused product thinking.


 👀 Why This Project Matters

It automatically transitions users from **student → alumni**, keeps engagement alive, and turns events into **interactive discussion hubs**, not just posters.

If you’re looking for:

* real authentication logic
* role-based dashboards
* secure backend workflows
* clean UI + UX decisions
